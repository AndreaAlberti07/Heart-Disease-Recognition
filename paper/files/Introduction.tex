\section{Introduction}
Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide.
Early diagnosis is critical for effective treatment and management.
Traditional methods of diagnosis often involve invasive procedures and expensive equipment.
Recent advancements in machine learning have opened new avenues for non-invasive diagnosis using heart sound recordings.
This paper explores the use of machine learning and network analysis to predict heart disease from heart beat audio signals.
Despite significant progress, gaps remain in accurately classifying heart sounds due to data imbalance and the presence of noise in recordings.
This study aims to address these gaps by employing advanced data preprocessing techniques and robust machine learning models.
The research question guiding this study is: How can machine learning models be optimized to improve the accuracy of heart disease prediction
from heart sound recordings?
