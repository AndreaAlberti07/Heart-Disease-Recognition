\subsection{Feature Extraction}
s demonstrated by \cite{Raza_Mehmood_Ullah_Ahmad_Choi_On_2019} and \cite{Chen_Sun_Chen_Xie_Wu_Xu_2021}, MFCCs 
are highly effective features for heartbeat classification. In addition to MFCCs, 
we incorporated other features to capture various characteristics of heart sounds, enhancing the classification accuracy.
The features used are explained in the following section.

\subsubsection{Features Type}  % Andrea
\textbf{MFCC}\newline
Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are representations of the short-term power spectrum of sound. 
They are derived by taking the Fourier transform of a signal, mapping the powers of the spectrum onto the mel 
scale, taking the logarithm, and then performing a discrete cosine transform. MFCCs are effective in capturing 
the timbral texture of audio and are widely used in speech and audio processing due to 
their ability to represent the envelope of the time power spectrum.
In heartbeat classification, MFFCs can reflect the different perceived quality of heart sounds,
such as the presence of murmurs or other anomalies.

\textbf{Chroma STFT}\newline
Chroma features represent the 12 different pitch classes of music (e.g., C, C\#, D, etc.). 
They are particularly useful for capturing harmonic and melodic characteristics in music. 
By mapping audio signals onto the chroma scale, these features can identify pitches regardless 
of the octave, making them useful for analyzing harmonic content in heart sounds.

\vspace{0.3cm}\noindent
\textbf{RMS}\newline
Root Mean Square (RMS) measures the magnitude of varying quantities, in this case, 
the amplitude of an audio signal. It is a straightforward way to compute the energy of 
the signal over a given time frame. RMS is useful in audio analysis for detecting volume 
changes and can help identify different types of heartbeats based on their energy levels.
For example, in a given timeframe the RMS may be altered by the presence of a murmur
with respect to a normal heart sound.

\vspace{0.3cm}\noindent
\textbf{ZCR}\newline
Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR) is the rate at which a signal changes sign, indicating how often the signal 
crosses the zero amplitude line. It is particularly useful for detecting the noisiness and the temporal 
structure of the signal. In heartbeat classification, ZCR can help differentiate between normal and abnormal 
sounds by highlighting changes in signal periodicity.

\vspace{0.3cm}\noindent
\textbf{CQT}\newline
Constant-Q Transform (CQT) is a time-frequency representation with a logarithmic frequency scale, making it 
suitable for musical applications. Since it captures more detail at lower frequencies, it may be useful for analyzing 
the low-frequency components of heart sounds.

\vspace{0.3cm}\noindent
\textbf{Spectral Centroid}\newline
The spectral centroid indicates the center of mass of the spectrum and is often perceived as the brightness of a 
sound. It is calculated as the weighted mean of the frequencies present in the signal, with their magnitudes as 
weights. In heart sound analysis, a higher spectral centroid can indicate sharper, more pronounced sounds, 
while a lower centroid suggests smoother sounds. 

\vspace{0.3cm}\noindent
\textbf{Spectral Bandwidth}\newline
Spectral bandwidth measures the width of the spectrum around the centroid, providing an indication of the range 
of frequencies present. It is calculated as the square root of the variance of the spectrum. This feature helps 
in understanding the spread of the frequency components in the heart sounds, which can be indicative of different 
heart conditions.

\vspace{0.3cm}\noindent
\textbf{Spectral Roll-off}
Spectral roll-off is the frequency below which a certain percentage of the total spectral energy lies. It is 
typically set at 85\% and helps distinguish between harmonic and non-harmonic content. In heartbeat classification, 
spectral roll-off can be used to differentiate between sounds with a concentrated energy distribution and those with more dispersed energy.
\subsubsection{Sampling Rate Selection} % Andrea
\label{sec:sampling_rate}
The sampling rate of the data were heterogeneous, ranging from 4000 Hz to 44100 Hz, with a majority of the data being sampled at 4000 Hz.
To assess the impact of the sampling rate on the classification performance, we trained different models on
different features, extracted at different sampling rates and from various intervals. Each model is then 
evaluated using different metrics, taking into account the class imbalance issue.
We also consider a possible dependency between the sampling rate and the extraction interval, as shown 
in Algorithm \ref{alg:sr_choice}.

\begin{algorithm}
    \small
    \caption{Sampling rate choice}
    \label{alg:sr_choice}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \State \textbf{Input:}
    \State {features} = [\texttt{mfcc30 \& 120}, \texttt{cqt30 \& 70}, \texttt{chroma12}]
    \State {sampling\_rates} = [\texttt{mix}, \texttt{4000}]
    \State {extraction\_intervals} = [\texttt{0.5}, \texttt{1}, \texttt{2}, \texttt{3}]
    \State {models} = [\texttt{rf}, \texttt{svm-rbf}, \texttt{lr}]
    \State {metrics} = [\texttt{macrof1}, \texttt{mcc}]
    
    \vspace{0.2cm}
    \For{sr \textbf{in} sampling\_rates}
        \For{interval \textbf{in} extraction\_intervals}
            \For{feature \textbf{in} features}
                \State \textbf{extract} {feature} with {interval} at {sr}
                \For{model \textbf{in} models}
                    \State \textbf{train} {model} with extracted {feature}
                    \For{metric \textbf{in} metrics}
                        \State \textbf{evaluate} {model} with {metric}
                    \EndFor
                \EndFor 
            \EndFor
        \EndFor
    \EndFor
    
    \State \textbf{Output:}
    \State Given all the results, group by \texttt{model} and average the values of a specific \texttt{metric} across \texttt{features}
    
    \end{algorithmic}
    \end{algorithm}

    \noindent
The results, reported in Figure \ref{fig:FE_sampling_rate.png} showed no evident advantage to using a mix of sampling frequencies over a fixed resampled sample rate. 
Moreover, employing a fixed sample rate of 4000 Hz reduces the risk of introducing bias, enhances efficiency, 
and permits the use of a broader range of features and models.

\subsubsection{Extraction Interval Selection}  % Andrea
\label{sec:extraction_interval}
The extraction interval refers to the duration of the audio segment from which the features are extracted.
Its choice was conducted similarly to the sampling rate selection, considering only the fixed sample rate of 4000 Hz.
However the interval also affects the number of samples available in each class, so it must be chosen carefully, 
especially considering the limited number of samples available for some classes.
The results showed that a 2-second interval yielded the best performance, however it also reduced the number of samples,
impeding a correct training and evaluation of the models. As a consequence, we picked a 1-second interval as a compromise.
