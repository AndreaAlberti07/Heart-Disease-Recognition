\subsection{Multiclass Model}
% big problem: class imbalance
% solution: class balancing with SMOTEN --> insert results
% results: best performance on raw data, this is because we pass the model the knowledge over the
% data frequency.
% we tried data augmentation by generating new training sample by Noise injection, Changing speed
% Changing pitch (see priori balancing notebook). However no significant improvement was observed.
% See confusion matrix with priori bal data.
