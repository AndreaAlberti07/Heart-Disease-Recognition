  abstractnote = {Heart sound signal analysis is an effective and convenient method for the preliminary diagnosis of heart disease. However, automatic heart sound classification is still a challenging problem which mainly reflected in heart sound segmentation and feature extraction from the corresponding segmentation results. In order to extract more discriminative features for heart sound classification, a scaled spectrogram and tensor decomposition based method was proposed in this study. In the proposed method, the spectrograms of the detected heart cycles are first scaled to a fixed size. Then a dimension reduction process of the scaled spectrograms is performed to extract the most discriminative features. During the dimension reduction process, the intrinsic structure of the scaled spectrograms, which contains important physiological and pathological information of the heart sound signals, is extracted using tensor decomposition method. As a result, the extracted features are more discriminative. Finally, the classification task is completed by support vector machine (SVM). Moreover, the proposed method is evaluated on three public datasets offered by the PASCAL classifying heart sounds challenge and 2016 PhysioNet challenge. The results show that the proposed method is competitive.},

  abstractnote = {Heart sound classification, used for the automatic heart sound auscultation and cardiac monitoring, plays an important role in primary health center and home care. However, one of the most difficult problems for the task of heart sound classification is the heart sound segmentation, especially for classifying a wide range of heart sounds accompanied with murmurs and other artificial noise in the real world. In this study, we present a novel framework for heart sound classification without segmentation based on the autocorrelation feature and diffusion maps, which can provide a primary diagnosis in the primary health center and home care. In the proposed framework, the autocorrelation features are first extracted from the sub-band envelopes calculated from the sub-band coefficients of the heart signal with the discrete wavelet decomposition (DWT). Then, the autocorrelation features are fused to obtain the unified feature representation with diffusion maps. Finally, the unified feature is input into the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier to perform the task of heart sound classification. Moreover, the proposed framework is evaluated on two public datasets published in the PASCAL Classifying Heart Sounds Challenge. The experimental results show outstanding performance of the proposed method, compared with the baselines.},

However, only a small number of PCG recordings is publicly available. Also, current recognition approaches have not reached a satisfiable accuracy. In this paper, we apply transfer learning to automate the recognition for heart rates normalities and abnormalities. Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC) signal representation is adopted to transform the output feature into a PCG image which is used as an input to pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. Then, several deep pre-trained CNN models are fine-tuned. The proposed approach is effective. Inception-ResNet-v2 pre-trained model achieves better performance than other models and other recent methods with an 89.5% of average classification accuracy using Pascal Heart Sound Challenge dataset.},

  abstractnote = {This paper proposes a framework based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automatic heart sound classification using short-segments of individual heart beats. We design a 1D-CNN that directly learns features from raw heart-sound signals, and a 2D-CNN that takes inputs of two-dimensional time-frequency feature maps based on Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. We further develop a time-frequency CNN ensemble (TF-ECNN) combining the 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN based on score-level fusion of the class probabilities. On the large PhysioNet CinC challenge 2016 database, the proposed CNN models outperformed traditional classifiers based on support vector machine and hidden Markov models with various hand-crafted time- and frequency-domain features. Best classification scores with 89.22% accuracy and 89.94% sensitivity were achieved by the ECNN, and 91.55% specificity and 88.82% modified accuracy by the 2D-CNN alone on the test set.},

  abstractnote = {Heart Disease (HD) is one of the fatal diseases across the world and takes maximum number of lives if detected late. Therefore, early detection of HD has become essential, so that appropriate treatment can be taken up to save lives. In this paper, the problem of HD detection from heart sound signal by employing imbalanced number of training and testing sets has been undertaken and suitable Machine learning (ML) based detection models have been developed. In addition, various performance metrics have been evaluated and analyzed. A novel ensemble model has also been developed for improved detection of heart murmur. The raw Heart Sound (HS) signals after preprocessing, denoising and features extraction have been fed to the proposed models. Two different features: Discrete wavelet transform (DWT), Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) as well as combination of these two sets of features have been separately used as inputs during the development phase of the proposed models. To assess the consistency in performance of the developed detection models, two standard datasets have been used for training and validation tasks. The classification models used in the current study are Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and Extreme Gradient Boost (XGB). These three machine learning based classifiers have been chosen because of their simplicity and already proven consistent performance in detection of other diseases. The best two performing models (RF and XGB) obtained from the simulation study have been identified and ensembled using Moth Flame Optimization (MFO) based weights selection scheme. Three different performance metrics such as (accuracy, F1-score and Area under the curve (AUC)) have been obtained through exhaustive simulation study and then analyzed. The results demonstrate that from amongst the combined features based three ML models, the RF detection scheme performs the best. This model provides an accuracy of 88.7%, F1 score of 0.89 and AUC of 0.95 for PhysioNet dataset and 86.16%, 0.86 and 0.89, respectively for Pascal CHSE dataset. But, the RF-MFO-XGB ensemble model achieves the best performance using the combined features as input. The performance measures in terms of accuracy, F1 score and AUC values of the ensemble models are 89.53%, 0.9 and 0.95, respectively. However, the corresponding metrics for Pascal CHSE dataset are found to be 87.89%, 0.87 and 0.93, respectively. Thus, the proposed ensemble provides consistent and improved performance. Hence, this model can be applied for detection of other diseases. In addition, the suggested model can be implemented under internet of things (IoT) environment and can be used at remote places.},
