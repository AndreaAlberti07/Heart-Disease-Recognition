## To do

1. **A priori balancing**:
    - [X] Cut the audio outliers
    - [X] Data augmentation for the smallest classes

2. **Engineering**:
    - [X] Feature Correlation
    - [X] Feature Normalization
    - [X] Feature Selection
    - [X] Outliers Detection

3. **A posteriori balancing**:
    - [ ] Oversampling
    - [ ] Undersampling


4. **Improve performance**:
    - [ ] Murmirs Normal and Extrastoles are often missclassified, identify additional features to discriminate them
