# What we have done until now

## 1. EDA

We have done some exploratory data analysis on the dataset to identify the class distribution, outliers and data visualization within classes

## 2. Feature extraction

We have extracted some features from the dataset, we have extracted the following features:

- MFCC
  -Chroma
  -RMS
  -ZCR
  -CQT
  -Spectral Centroid
  -Spectral Bandwidth
  -Spectral Roll-off

### Sample rate and interval selection

We have selected a sample rate of 4000 Hz and an interval of 2 seconds for the feature extraction

## 3. Feature selection

### 3.1 Optimal number of features for each type of feature

We have selected the following number of features for each type of feature:

| Type                | NÂ° Features |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| MFCC                | 30          |
| CQT                 | 70          |
| Chroma              | 12          |
| RMS                 | 40          |
| Zero Crossing Rates | 40          |
| Spectral Centroid   | 40          |
| Spectral Bandwidth  | 60          |
| Spectral Rolloff    | 40          |

### 3.2 Balancing method selection

We have selected the following balancing methods:

- No balancing
- Prior balancing
- Posterior balancing
- Both balancing -> OPTIMAL

### 3.3 Correlation analysis

#### 3.3.1 Correlation thresholds selection

f1_score macro: (0.0, 0.6, 30) - 0.8646068456432318

#### 3.3.2 Correlation analysis and feature selection

We have selected the following features:

MFCC: 25
Chroma: 12
CQT: 1
RMS: 0
ZCR: 1

'MFCC 27', 'MFCC 28', 'MFCC 29', 'MFCC 30', 'Chroma 2', 'CQT 7',
'ZCR 5', 'label'],

## 4. Model selection

We have selected the following models:

- Random Forest
- MLP -> OPTIMAL
- CatBoost
- XGBoost

## 5. Hyperparameter tuning

We have performed hyperparameter tuning on the selected model

## 6. Model evaluation and analysis
